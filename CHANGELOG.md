### Changed

**Agent Specifications:**
- 🔄 Agent specs now use formal v1 schema with validation
- 🔄 YAML format for human authoring, JSON for execution
- 🔄 Required fields: name, version, description, system_prompt
- 🔄 Enhanced tool configuration with per-tool settings
- 🔄 Runtime configuration embedded in spec

**Repository Structure:**
- 🔄 Reorganized agents/ directory with clear separation:
  - `specs/` - YAML agent definitions
  - `library/` - Pre-built agents
  - `orchestrator/` - Multi-agent coordination
  - `tools/` - Tool implementations
  - `toolsets/` - Domain collections
  - `evals/` - Test suites
- 🔄 Created `kb/` directory for knowledge base
- 🔄 Created `registry/` for auto-generated catalogs
- 🔄 Moved core framework to `src/cbw_foundry/`

**Build Process:**
- 🔄 Added compilation step (YAML → JSON)
- 🔄 Registry generation from specs
- 🔄 Automated validation in CI
- 🔄 Pre-commit hooks enforce quality

**Dependencies:**
- 🔄 Updated to Pydantic v2.x
